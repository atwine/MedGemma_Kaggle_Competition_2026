EXAMPLE TWO 

ARTEMIS Review — Pre-renal AKI from Dehydration (Not TDF Toxicity)
Kidney injury caused by dehydration, not by ARV medication
🔍 Most likely cause: Severe dehydration from infectious gastroenteritis
This is NOT TDF nephrotoxicity. Evidence: (1) Creatinine was normal on TDF for 2 years before this episode, (2) No protein or glucose in the urine — TDF damage leaves a specific pattern (proteinuria + glycosuria) that is absent here, (3) Urea:creatinine ratio is 24:1, consistent with dehydration-related kidney injury rather than drug damage, (4) Patient has had severe diarrhoea and vomiting for 5 days — enough to cause kidney failure from fluid loss alone, (5) Family members have the same illness, pointing to an infectious outbreak.

Suggested Management Plan
✅ AGREE
Clinician's plan: IV fluid resuscitation
Supports: Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation — this is the priority. Patient is severely dehydrated with hypotension (90/60), tachycardia (112), and signs of severe volume depletion.
✅ AGREE
Clinician's plan: Empiric antibiotics for gastroenteritis
Supports: Continue empiric antibiotics pending stool microscopy results.
🔄 REVIEW
Clinician's plan: Considering stopping TDF permanently
Consider instead: Temporarily HOLD TLD during acute illness. Plan to RESTART once rehydrated and creatinine recovering.
Reason: This kidney injury is from dehydration, not from TDF. Evidence: baseline creatinine was normal on TDF for 2 years, no proteinuria or glycosuria, urea:creatinine ratio consistent with pre-renal cause, family members affected. Permanently switching would unnecessarily disrupt a regimen that has been working well for 2 years.
➕ ADD
Not in current plan
Consider adding: Monitor creatinine daily during rehydration — expect improvement within 48–72 hours.
Reason: If creatinine improves with rehydration, this confirms a pre-renal cause. If it does NOT improve despite adequate fluids, then reassess for other causes including intrinsic renal damage.
➕ ADD
Not in current plan
Consider adding: Correct electrolyte abnormalities — potassium 3.1 (low), sodium 132 (low).
Reason: Hypokalaemia from GI losses needs potassium replacement. Hyponatraemia should correct with IV fluids. Monitor electrolytes daily.

Monitoring: Creatinine + electrolytes daily × 3 days. Once creatinine <1.5 and patient tolerating oral intake → restart TLD. Recheck creatinine 1 week after restarting TLD to confirm stability. Stool microscopy result to guide antibiotic choice.
Counselling: Explain that the kidney problem is from the diarrhoea and dehydration, not from the HIV medication. The HIV medication will be paused for a few days while he recovers and restarted once he is eating and drinking normally. Emphasise oral rehydration (ORS) and completing any prescribed antibiotics.
