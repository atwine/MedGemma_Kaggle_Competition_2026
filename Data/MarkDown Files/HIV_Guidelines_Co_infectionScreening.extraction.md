## 5.4 CO-INFECTION SCREENING, TREATMENT, AND PREVENTION

### 5.4.1 HIV and Tuberculosis

HIV is the strongest risk factor for developing TB disease. PLHIV are 20–37 times more likely to develop TB than HIV-uninfected individuals. TB is also the leading cause of HIV-related hospitalization and mortality. TB accounts for 27% and 30% of deaths among hospitalized HIV-infected adults and children, respectively. Also, patients with TB and HIV have poorer treatment outcomes (such as death) compared to patients with TB alone. In Uganda, about 40% of all TB cases in clinical settings are co-infected with HIV. Therefore, all patients with presumptive or diagnosed TB should be routinely screened for HIV and all PLHIV should be routinely screened for TB. The Ministry of Health further recommends that TB/HIV services should be provided at the same location and preferably by the same health worker (see Figure 34).

4. Do a Molecular WHO Recommended Diagnostic (mWRD) test e.g., Genexpert, TRUENAT and TB-LAMP, if you are able to obtain a specimen, so as to rule out rifampicin resistance. Note TB LAMP does not detect rifampicin resistance.
5. For any TB LAM positive other co-morbidities such as cryptococcus, bacterial infections should be ruled out.
6. Children less than 5 years who are new and have been on ART for less than one year are eligible for a TB LAM test if they have AHD symptoms and signs (refer to the symptom screen and advanced disease management pathway).

* Remember to do HIV test for all children with presumptive and diagnosed TB

CONDUCT A CLINICAL EXAMINATION

ARE YOU ABLE TO OBTAIN A SAMPLE FOR GENEXPERT OR MICROSCOPY? (Refer to 'A')

- YES -> DOES THE CHILD HAVE POSITIVE GENEXPERT OR MICROSCOPY?
  - YES -> TREAT FOR TB AND REFER TO ART GUIDELINES IF THE CHILD IS HIV POSITIVE (Refer to 'E')
  - NO -> DOES THE HIV NEGATIVE CHILD HAVE 2 OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING? OR DOES THE HIV POSITIVE CHILD HAVE 1 OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING?
    1. 2 or more symptoms suggestive of TB (Refer to 'B')
    2. Positive history of contact with a PTB case
    3. Any physical signs suggestive of TB (Refer to 'C')
    4. CXR suggestive of PTB (Refer to 'D')
    - YES -> TREAT FOR TB AND REFER TO ART GUIDELINES IF THE CHILD IS HIV POSITIVE (Refer to 'E')
    - NO -> GIVE APPROPRIATE TREATMENT ACCORDING TO IMCI GUIDELINES AND RE-ASSESS AFTER 1-2 WEEKS
      IF CHILD IS STILL UNWELL, REFER FOR FURTHER EVALUATION.
- NO -> DOES THE HIV NEGATIVE CHILD HAVE 2 OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING? OR DOES THE HIV POSITIVE CHILD HAVE 1 OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING?
  1. 2 or more symptoms suggestive of TB (Refer to 'B')
  2. Positive history of contact with a PTB case
  3. Any physical signs suggestive of TB (Refer to 'C')
  4. CXR suggestive of PTB (Refer to 'D')
  - YES -> TREAT FOR TB AND REFER TO ART GUIDELINES IF THE CHILD IS HIV POSITIVE (Refer to 'E')
  - NO -> GIVE APPROPRIATE TREATMENT ACCORDING TO IMCI GUIDELINES AND RE-ASSESS AFTER 1-2 WEEKS
    IF CHILD IS STILL UNWELL, REFER FOR FURTHER EVALUATION.

TB SCREENING IN INFANTS, CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS AND ADULTS

<a id='061618a8-762b-4e24-ae3b-4b3ae7032eaf'></a>

# TB Screening

TB screening should be conducted at each clinic visit using the intensified case finding (ICF) guide (see Annex 5). All HIV-positive infants and children who have any of the symptoms of TB, including cough of any duration, persistent fevers, poor weight gain and history of TB contact should be assessed for TB. All HIV-positive adolescents and adults who have any of the symptoms of TB including cough of any duration, persistent fevers, weight loss, or excessive night sweats should be assessed for TB. Where possible, chest X-ray can be used for screening.

<a id='2b7e6569-27e4-48fe-926e-17e133e0ab8b'></a>

## Tools for systematic TB screening and diagnosis among
people living with HIV

All PLHIV should be screened for TB at each care visit using the ICF guide. If available, POC-CRP should be used for TB screening in addition to the symptom screen for adolescents and adults. If available, CXR should also be used for TB screening.

<a id='19717dab-27cf-468c-b3f1-fc5778f036e4'></a>

Note: Computer-aided detection (CAD) software programs are recommended for individuals aged 15 years and older
If the symptom screen is positive and/or CRP cutoff is more than 5mg/L, or CXR is abnormal, the client has presumptive TB and should be tested using a molecular WHO recommended rapid diagnostic test (mWRD) e.g., nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) such as GeneXpert, TRUENAT and TB LAMP. If mWRD is not available on site, do smear microscopy and refer a sample for mWRD test. If the mWRD is negative, do further clinical evaluation and a chest X- ray to aid in clinical diagnosis of TB. (See section on diagnosis).

<a id='4270ffda-0123-4f4d-9658-996c5eb3e2a0'></a>

Note: CRP point of care test is not recommended for children younger than 10 years of age. For TB screening where CRP is not available, use a chest X-ray

<a id='41ad7cab-ecc0-4d64-9c9f-03da0aa210d3'></a>

**TB diagnosis in HIV-infected infants, children, adolescents and adults**
The molecular WHO recommended rapid diagnostic (mWRD) test is the recommended TB diagnostic test for all PLHIV (Annex 6 and Annex 7) with

presumptive TB. Examples include; GeneXpert, TRUENAT, TB LAMP.
For PLHIV with CD4<200 cells/ µL and seriously ill PLHIV (have danger
signs), do a lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan assay (Urine TB LAM) test
because it has a shorter turnaround time followed by mWRD which is more
sensitive and can detect rifampicin resistance (note that among mWRDs, the
Xpert MTB/RIF detects rifampicin resistance in a single step whereas the TRUNAT
detects rifampicin resistance in two steps). If either test is positive, classify patient as
PBC (Pulmonary Bacteriologically Confirmed) and start anti-TB treatment.
In health facilities without on-site access to mWRD, smear microscopy
(Ziehl- Nielsen/Fluorescent microscopy) TB test should be performed and
a second sample referred for mWRD testing using the hub transport system.
If the mWRD is positive and indicates rifampicin resistance, refer the patient
to an MDR-TB treatment site.

<a id='678f541e-ad22-4602-92ed-c89b72ed3b78'></a>

In addition to the mWRD test, chest radiography is another useful investigation for aiding diagnosis of TB especially among infants and children.

<a id='706188a9-dc7f-4a73-8d88-89bc43fa6dce'></a>

Note: The mWRD used should have the capacity to detect rifampicin resistance.

<a id='7dae47dc-a109-4597-9b46-cc38a010f2cb'></a>

## TB Treatment
The recommended TB treatment regimens for TB-HIV co-infected patients are similar to those used for HIV-negative individuals with TB (Table 35).

ART for TB/HIV co-infected patients

ART should be initiated in all TB/HIV co-infected people irrespective of their clinical stage or CD4 count. However, the timing of initiating treatment may differ based on whether the patient is diagnosed with TB before or after initiating ART.

<a id='980a58f6-8d90-4ec0-b1b4-1b925ee76ace'></a>

Timing of ART for adults, adolescents and children being treated for HIV-associated TB

ART should be started as soon as possible within two weeks of initiating TB treatment, regardless of CD4 cell count, among people living with HIV (Except when signs and symptoms of meningitis are present)
* If the patient is already on ART, start TB treatment immediately and adjust the ART regimen as recommended (Table 36 and Table 37).
* If the patient is not on ART, initiate anti-TB treatment immediately and start ART two weeks after initiation of TB treatment.
* If the patient is not on ART and is diagnosed with MDR-TB, ART should be initiated 4-6 weeks after second-line TB treatment initiation. However, if the patient is already on ART, continue ART and adjust ART regimen as per the MDR TB guidelines.

<a id='aa6df158-7406-410b-88a3-9bc2311be1f1'></a>

**First-line ART regimen for TB/HIV co-infected patients**
**who are not on ART**

There are situations when a new patient is diagnosed with both HIV and TB.
The recommended first line regimen for a TB patient initiating ART are as
indicated in Table 39.

<a id='f6caef1a-1d31-4837-a7da-253ac5b5508d'></a>

**ART and TB treatment Drug interaction**

Patients should be initiated on ART following the ART guidelines for initiating 1st and 2nd line ART (See **Table 39**), however, considerations must be taken to avoid drug-drug interactions that interfere with the effectiveness of ART (see Table 40 and Table 82).

<a id='4b546e58-3935-45a4-9d0f-fe8112230b5f'></a>

Notes:
1. The use of Rifampicin with PIs is contraindicated. These guidelines recommend substitution of Rifampicin with Rifabutin when using PIs. However, in the absence of Rifabutin:
2. LPV/r can be given at double the usual dose (give double the dose in the morning and double the dose in the evening). In children <20kg who are on LPV/r regimens, super boost the morning and evening doses with ritonavir with additional ritonavir (RTV) (to make LPV/r ratio of 1:1 instead of 4:1, i.e. equal doses of LPV and RTV). After TB treatment return to normal dose of LPV/r.
3. Doubling the dose of ATV/r or DRV/r is NOT recommended. ATV/r and DRV/r should only be used with a TB regimen containing Rifabutin. In the scenario where Rifabutin is unavailable, an alternative ARV should be selected.
4. For patients initiating 2nd line ART, it is important to take into consideration the previous failing regimen to ensure selection of an effective regimen for use in 2nd line ART-TB co-treatment.
5. Raltegravir (given as a double dose) is recommended in TB-HIV co-treatment for children who cannot tolerate double dosing of LPV/r or for whom Rifabutin is unavailable for treatment with DRV/r.
6. Children <20Kg on TB treatment should only be initiated on a triple NRTI regimen (ABC+3TC+AZT) if all the other options provided in the table above are not feasible, as this is an inferior regimen.
After completion of TB treatment, all ART regimens that are not optimal, should be optimized (in line with the ART guidelines).

<a id='d0d2e416-a76a-4e9e-a0a5-8f3e723d4ae6'></a>

### 5.4.1.1 ART regimen substitutions for patients diagnosed with TB while on ART

Anti-TB treatment should be initiated immediately upon diagnosis while continuing ART. However, the ARV regimen should be reviewed and may need substitutions to ensure optimal treatment of both TB and HIV and to decrease the potential for toxicities and drug–drug interactions (Table 40).

Note:
1. In case ARVs are to be substituted in patients initiating TB treatment while on ART, careful consideration of previous ART regimens should be taken in order not to give an ARV to which the client may already have resistance.
2. Raltegravir (given as a double dose) is recommended in TB-HIV co-treatment for children who cannot tolerate double dosing of LPV/r or for whom Rifabutin is unavailable for treatment with DRV/r.
3. Children on NVP-based regimens should be switched to a triple NRTI regimen (ABC+3TC+AZT) only if EFV is contraindicated, as this is an inferior regimen.
4. *After completion of TB treatment, ensure that the ART regimen is optimized:
5. If virally suppressed, optimize the regimen.
6. For adults, when optimizing 2nd line PI-based regimens, ensure that the client was not previously exposed to DTG in the 1st line ART regimen. If the client was on a DTG-based 1st line ART Regimen and is currently on a PI-based 2nd line regimen and virally suppressed, maintain the PI-based regimen after TB treatment.
7. If viral load is not suppressed switch the client to 2nd or 3rd line following the recommendations in Chapter 13 (see recommended first and second line in Table 81).

<a id='fa6faa19-b6e6-4abe-857b-99c195f85c3c'></a>

TB PREVENTION
TB prevention should be based on the following principles:
* Vaccination with BCG to prevent severe forms of TB in children.
* Early identification and prompt treatment of TB patients.
* Providing TB Preventive Treatment (TPT).
* Implementation of infection control practices within the health facility and household settings.

<a id='28318011-1c50-4f35-b8f9-9f5cb28342f8'></a>

**TB Preventive Treatment (TPT)**

TPT prevents the progression of TB infection to active TB disease. All PLHIV with a negative TB symptom screen should be evaluated for TPT eligibility and offered TPT if eligible (see section 6.7.4.1.1). TPT is currently **NOT** recommended for contacts of patients with MDR-TB.

<a id='5e1c20bf-2e80-4c8d-a9b5-bde3e6334770'></a>

## Algorithms to rule out active TB disease
Adults and adolescents living with HIV should be screened for TB according to a clinical algorithm. Those who do not report any of the symptoms of current cough, fever, weight loss or night sweats are unlikely to have active TB and should be offered preventive treatment, regardless of their ART status.

<a id='f58cbd79-fce9-4513-866f-27396dab9767'></a>

Adults and adolescents living with HIV who are screened for TB according
to a clinical algorithm and who report any of the symptoms of current
cough, fever, weight loss or night sweats may have active TB and should
be evaluated for TB and other diseases and offered preventive treatment if
active TB is excluded.

<a id='38418949-df7b-4a82-82b1-b24e3fa1ad9e'></a>

Chest radiography may be offered to people living with HIV receiving ART

regardless of their age.

<a id='b8ce838d-3e4b-4687-b66f-849f7ca4d808'></a>

The following regimens could be used for TPT as guided in **Table 41** and **Table 42** below:

*   6H: Daily Isoniazid for 6 months.
*   Note: Isoniazid may be available in combination with co-trimoxazole and pyridoxine as a fixed dose combination referred to as Q-TIB: In this case, Q-TIB is also administered daily for 6 months.
*   3HP: Weekly Isoniazid and Rifapentine for 3 months (Recommended for patients aged more than 2 years).
*   3RH: Daily Rifampicin and Isoniazid for 3 months (Recommended for children less than 15 years).

<a id='83a1f342-beed-419c-be3d-af965cf425cd'></a>

NOTE: Isoniazid containing TPT should be coupled with pyridoxine to prevent peripheral neuropathy

<a id='1575c038-3752-4feb-9735-e579f7ed204a'></a>

## Eligibility for TPT

*   Infants aged <one year living with HIV who are in contact with a person with TB and who are unlikely to have active TB on an appropriate clinical evaluation or according to national guidelines should receive TB preventive treatment
*   HIV-positive children (≥one year of age), adolescents and adults with no signs and symptoms of TB irrespective of ART status
*   HIV-positive infants and children <5 years with a history of TB contact who have no signs and symptoms of active TB disease, irrespective of previous TPT.
*   HIV-positive pregnant mothers with a history of contact with a TB patient after ruling out active TB.
*   HIV-positive pregnant mothers with a WHO Stage 3 or 4 event and/or CD4<200 without active TB.
*   TPT should also be given to those who have previously been treated for TB immediately after completing TB treatment.
*   Note:
    *   TPT should be offered to eligible patients irrespective of the degree of immunosuppression and even when latent TB infection testing is unavailable.
    *   For HIV-positive pregnant mothers without a history of TB exposure, TPT will be deferred until 3 months after delivery.

## Timing of TPT in children
*   **Contacts of known TB patients**: Initiate TPT immediately (or within 2 weeks of ART initiation if newly identified HIV positive)
*   **Virally suppressed children currently on NNRTI**: Initiate TPT as soon as possible and complete course before ART optimization.
*   **Virally suppressed children currently on PI or DTG**: Initiate TPT if the child has been on ART for at least 3 months.
*   **Newly initiating ART**: Initiate TPT prophylaxis after 3 months on ART.

these drugs. Since there is potential for hepatotoxicity, the following are recommendations for co-administration.
a. **New Patient**: For newly identified patients, start on TLD with active symptomatic monitoring for adverse events (Chapter 14). Initiate TPT after 3 months to allow time for potential unmasking of TB and to monitor any toxicities that may arise from DTG, prior to initiation of TPT.
b. For stable patients already transitioned to DTG: If patient has been on TLD for 3 months or more, initiate TPT immediately.
c. If client is already on TPT and a non-DTG based regimen: Optimization to DTG will be deferred until completion of TPT.
d. Stable patients for DTG transition and have not received TPT before:
   a. In case TLE stock is available: First complete TPT and then transition to DTG.
   b. In case TLE stock is not available: Transition to DTG and initiate TPT after 3 months.

<a id='ef933cee-37db-4a26-a5f0-8707ec9a13dc'></a>

## BCG vaccination

BCG is protective against severe forms of TB such as miliary TB and TB Meningitis and is administered at birth in Uganda. However, if an infant did not receive BCG at birth and is **confirmed to be HIV-positive**, s/he should not be given BCG unless they are stable on ART. The follow up of a neonate born to an HIV-positive mother with active TB is summarized in Figure 38.

<a id='f54c3f43-aca7-427c-82b9-b8201e02e4f7'></a>

Figure 37: Follow up of a Neonate born to an HIV-positive Mother with Active TB.
<::Neonate born of a mother with PTB

- Mother is on TB treatment and is smear negative.
  - Examine the neonate for signs of disease.
  - If the neonate is well, give BCG.
  - Do not give BCG vaccine if the neonate is unwell.
  - Investigate for TB if neonate has symptoms for TB.

- Mother is NOT on TB treatment; OR on TB treatment but still smear positive.
  - Do not give BCG vaccine.
  - Examine the neonate for signs of disease.
  - If the neonate is well, initiate TPT.
  - Do not give BCG until 2 weeks after completing TPT (and stable on ART for children who are HIV positive).
  - Investigate for TB if neonate has symptoms for TB.
  - Evaluate and treat mother according to the guideline.

COTRIMOXAZOLE PREVENTIVE THERAPY

Cotrimoxazole preventive therapy (CPT) can reduce the risk of malaria, diarrhoea and pneumonia caused by bacterial infections; hospitalization; and mortality. However, the benefits of CPT reduce markedly in clients who are stable on ART. For this reason, only certain categories of PLHIV listed below should be maintained on CPT.

<a id='2b2a824b-727a-4192-ad46-5b24dd816f93'></a>

**The following groups have been prioritized for cotrimoxazole preventive therapy:**

* All PLHIV newly initiating on ART.
* Those having a current WHO stage 3 or 4 event or other symptoms of advanced disease.
* Pregnant and breast-feeding women.

<a id='0ced5bfc-441a-4979-b3ea-3dce6540162a'></a>

Note: Additional intermittent preventive treatment for malaria using
Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine (SP) is not required for pregnant women
on CPT.

## Guidance for when to stop CPT in stable PLHIV

To ensure that CPT is stopped without adversely affecting the health of PLHIV, health workers should carefully select PLHIV for CPT discontinuation. The five (5) conditions below should be fulfilled prior to CPT discontinuation:
* Patient should be older than 15 years of age.
* Patient should not be pregnant.

<a id='8233b5f8-3605-4468-9bbc-2d7614e5fee6'></a>

Consolidated Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of HIV and Aids in Uganda - 2022

* Patient should have been on ART for at least one year.
* Patient should not have a current WHO stage 3 or 4 event or other symptoms of advanced HIV disease at the time of stopping CPT.

<a id='0335c07a-3248-42ee-a16e-851e092f40db'></a>

## Restarting CPT in PLHIV

CPT can be restarted in the following scenarios:

* New pregnancy
  In case CPT was stopped earlier (in stable women), re-start CPT and maintain it throughout pregnancy and in the immediate postpartum period (up to 6 weeks after delivery).

* Suspected treatment failure
  If VL becomes unsuppressed in a patient whose CPT was previously discontinued, re-start CPT and continue until the VL is again suppressed.

* New Treatment WHO stage 3 or 4 condition
  In case CPT was discontinued earlier, it should be restarted when a patient develops an active WHO stage 3 or 4 infection and continued until the condition has been treated and resolved.

<a id='3b4c95c8-fa06-4ed9-a46c-d2562210c668'></a>

**Contraindications to CPT**
CPT should not be given to people with known allergy to sulphur-containing
drugs or trimethoprim, severe anaemia,and/or severe neutropenia (<5000
cells/mm3).

<a id='187ef647-32d8-454f-9afa-6ba0a3daf801'></a>

**Alternate Drugs for Hypersensitivity or Contraindication to Cotrimoxazole**

In patients with Cotrimoxazole hypersensitivity, Dapsone should be used. Dapsone provides protection against PJP. It does not have the other preventive benefits CPT provides. Therefore, pregnant women receiving Dapsone should also receive intermittent preventive therapy for Malaria with Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (Fansidar). In the rare event that a patient who has hypersensitivity to Cotrimoxazole also reacts to Dapsone, Atovaquone can be given as an alternative.

<a id='e7e44ea1-44ec-4e23-b467-28cd9d9a006a'></a>

### Dapsone dosing
* Weight of ≥25Kg: 100mg once a day or 1.4mg/kg in children

highest risk of CM. This section describes screening and management of
early Cryptococcal disease.

<a id='7ed782a9-d3cb-472c-94fe-3a475761bed5'></a>

## Screening and management of early Cryptococcal disease

The following categories of patients should be screened for Cryptococcal disease:
* All HIV-infected ART-naïve with CD4 <200 cells/mm³
* ART experienced PLHIV returning to care after 90 days of treatment interruption with CD4 <200 cells/mm³.
* All HIV-infected virologically unsuppressed patients with CD4 <200 cells/mm³.
* All patients with WHO Stage 3 or 4 event.
* All PLHIV who have a positive symptom screen on the Advanced Disease Pathway.

<a id='d967f4f5-a0a4-4aaf-be88-f6204a4fdf12'></a>

How to screen for Cryptococcal disease

1. To screen for Cryptococcal disease, health workers should do Cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) test using the lateral flow assay (LFA) on plasma, serum, or finger-prick blood. The LFA for Cryptococcal antigen has the advantage that does not require laboratory infrastructure. It can be done at the bedside using finger prick whole blood.
2. The process of screening patients for Cryptoccoccal Meningitis is guided by the algorithm in Figure 17.

<a id='92d219bd-bf30-4410-ba3e-ae0b6052a814'></a>

**For serum CrAg positive patients at facilities where lumbar puncture can be performed**

*   Patients with a positive serum CrAg should be assessed for early and late signs and symptoms of CM including decreased hearing, dizziness or light-headedness, cognitive delay (acting unusual to friends, family or provider), difficulty walking, double or blurry vision, weak arms or legs, headache, presence of seizures, altered consciousness, photophobia, neck stiffness, or a positive Kernig's or Brudzinski sign.
*   Patients with a positive serum CrAg are at high risk of having CM even in the absence of symptoms. Therefore, a lumbar puncture is recommended for all patients with a positive serum CrAg test to exclude CM. The CrAg test should be conducted on CSF.
    *   If the CSF CrAg test is negative with or without signs of CNS disease: the patient has Cryptoccoccal disease but without CNS involvement and the patient should be started on pre-emptive therapy.
    *   If the CSF CrAg test is positive, the patient has CM and should be treated for Cryptococcal Meningitis (see Table 44).

**For serum CrAg-positive patients at facilities where lumbar puncture cannot be performed**
Health workers at some health facilities may not be trained to do LPs. Patients at such sites should also be assessed for signs of CM. Patients with early or late Cryptococcal disease findings should be started on daily Fluconazole 1200mg, counseled and referred to a site where LP can be done.

<a id='d4cd0593-7cbc-45ea-88ea-ddfd771afc15'></a>

**For serum CrAg-negative patients**

Assess the patient for signs and symptoms of Cryptococcal Meningitis including decreased hearing, dizziness or light-headedness, cognitive delay (acting unusual to friends, family or provider), difficulty walking, double or blurry vision, weak arms or legs, headache, presence of seizures, altered consciousness, photophobia, neck stiffness, and a positive Kernig's or Brudzinski's sign.

<a id='bad038f3-10df-4ea0-b19a-c3930509c41f'></a>

If there are no signs of Meningitis, start ART in the patient immediately.
If there are signs of Meningitis, do a lumbar puncture and CSF gram stain,
including CSF CrAg and GeneXpert and manage accordingly.

<a id='dda0f253-db4b-4faa-8010-2da39b7d7c1a'></a>

## Diagnosis of Cryptococcal Meningitis

The diagnosis of Cryptococcal Meningitis can only be made by demonstrating the presence of Cryptococcal antigen in cerebrospinal fluid or a positive culture showing Cryptococcal yeasts. A lumbar puncture and CrAg test on CSF (CSF CrAg) is the recommended diagnostic approach for Cryptococcal Meningitis. However, if a patient has signs and symptoms of Cryptoccoccal Meningitis and a lumbar puncture cannot be performed for any reason, it is recommended to perform a rapid serum CrAg using the LFA and treat as possible Cryptoccoccal Meningitis.

<a id='a99a8f10-4141-4255-a36b-7ea58cdbba87'></a>

### Treatment of Cryptococcal Meningitis

There are three phases in the treatment of Cryptococcal Meningitis: the induction phase, consolidation phase, and maintenance phase. The drugs for the different phases, duration of treatment, when to initiate ART, when to stop antifungals, how to prevent drug toxicity, how to manage increased intracranial pressure, and relapse disease are summarized in Table 36.

<a id='25d8b4ac-50ce-4a96-9c83-983dece0f112'></a>

**Considerations for drug interactions during treatment of Cryptococcal disease**
* Antifungals and aminoglycosides (e.g. Gentamicin): Increased risk of nephrotoxicity. Avoid combining the drug classes.

Consolidated Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of HIV and Aids in Uganda - 2022

*   Antifungals and cardiac glycosides (e.g. Digoxin): Increased risk of cardiac toxicity, especially in clients with hypokalemia. Monitor potassium very closely.
*   Antifungals and antiepileptic medicines: Antifungals may increase serum concentration of carbamazepine, alprazolam, and other benzodiazepines. May need to reduce antiepileptic by 50% if concurrently using or monitor very closely.
*   Amphotericin B and non-potassium sparing diuretics: Increased risk of hypokalemia. Ensure adequate potassium supplementation.
*   Amphotericin B and Flucytosine: Amphotericin B can decrease renal clearance of 5-FC, and increase cellular uptake, which may increase the risk of 5-FC toxicity. May require close monitoring of liver function.
*   Nevirapine use and Fluconazole: Fluconazole increases plasma concentration of Nevirapine and some protease inhibitors. Monitor closely for toxicity.
*   TB medicines and Fluconazole: Rifampicin increases the metabolism of Fluconazole, thus increase the dose of Fluconazole by 50%.
*   Pregnant and breastfeeding women: Whereas there is no data against the use of Amphotericin B in pregnancy, it is not encouraged. There have been numerous reports of multiple congenital abnormalities associated with long-term use of high dose Fluconazole in the first trimester of pregnant women. The recommendation is to treat Cryptoccoccal Meningitis in pregnancy with Amphotericin B. Avoid Fluconazole during the first trimester and preferably start Fluconazole after delivery. Flucytosine is teratogenic in animals and should only be used when no alternative is available. In liver disease, use with caution.

*Decision on which ART regimen to restart should be made according to patient's history, ART guidelines, HIV viral load and genotypic resistance testing if possible. If it is considered likely that the patient has developed resistance to 1st line ARVs, then restart with 2nd line containing boosted PI or DTG is possible. ** Unless documented to have a suppressed viral load at time of admission or within the month prior to admission, in which case continue ART

### 5.4.5 HIV and Histoplasmosis

Histoplasmosis is a disease caused by the fungus *Histoplasma Capsulatum*. Histoplasmosis is one of the most frequent opportunistic infections caused by fungal pathogens among people living with HIV. The symptoms of disseminated histoplasmosis are non-specific and may be indistinguishable from those of other infectious diseases, especially disseminated tuberculosis (TB), thus complicating diagnosis and treatment.

### 5.4.6 HIV and Aspergillosis

Aspergillus species continue to be an important cause of life-threatening infection in immunocompromised patients. Recent evidence suggests that chronic pulmonary aspergillosis and aspergillus sensitisation might be responsible for significant mortality in patients treated for tuberculosis in Uganda. Aspergillus infection may complicate active pulmonary TB and efforts need to be made to rule out aspergillosis in PLHIV presenting with advanced HIV disease.

<a id='bf8f183d-950a-403c-847d-34230fa51917'></a>

There are 3 major forms of aspergillosis: invasive aspergillosis (IA); chronic (and saprophytic) forms of aspergillosis; and allergic forms of aspergillosis. Given the clinical importance of IA, emphasis is placed upon the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of the different forms of IA, including invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), Aspergillus sinusitis, disseminated aspergillosis, and several types of single-organ IA

5.4.7 HIV and NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASE

Uganda suffers a dual burden of NCDs and HIV/AIDS with an overall
prevalence of pre-hypertension of 38.8% among its 42 million population.
HIV-infected adults experience more chronic metabolic complications
because of both the HIV infection itself and ART. They are more likely
to develop Diabetes Mellitus (DM), hypertension and mental illness as
compared to HIV-negative individuals. Studies report that up to 10% of
HIV-positive patients on ART develop DM within four years and 24.3%
of 15,000 persons living with HIV (PLHIV) screened at an urban clinic in
Uganda were found to be hypertensive. Currently health care services for

these conditions are organised in separate(vertical) clinics making it difficult
for a patient with multiple conditions to access care. Evidence from studies
have shown that Integrating care for HIV and NCDs is feasible, acceptable,
less costly and a possible solution to improving access to care among patients
with multiple conditions.

<a id='8cab59eb-a0c0-4277-a79d-7f42f5b4b3c0'></a>

At each clinic visit, the patient should be screened for the common NCDs particularly diabetes mellitus, hypertension and mental health (anxiety, depression, substance and alcohol use disorders).

<a id='acb9a522-90c6-41b1-a9ef-2faf6dbdd0ae'></a>

## 5.4.7.1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM)

**Risk factors for development of diabetes mellitus in HIV-positive patients**

*   In addition to the usual risk factors for development of DM, there are several HIV-related risk factors:
*   Fluctuating viral load and CD4 cell count which cause a chronic inflammatory state which may induce insulin resistance.
*   Rapid weight gain, co-infection with Hepatitis C, dyslipidemia, and lipodystrophy.
*   Anti-retroviral drugs are a major cause of the development of DM in PLHIV. Protease inhibitors such as Lopinavir, and Ritonavir cause insulin resistance by causing lipodystrophy, impaired glucose transporter type 4 translocation, reduced adipocyte differentiation, reduced insulin secretion, and dyslipidemia with lipotoxicity. Hyperglycemia has been reported among HIV patients on DTG. Although causality has not yet been determined, systems for pharmacovigilance are recommended to assess the relationship and guide mitigation measures.

<a id='bbe0d420-f0a6-4584-bd9f-76ab6f7e7b3b'></a>

### Screening and diagnosis for DM

Patients should be assessed for risk factors for DM before initiation of ART, while on ART, and when clinically indicated using the DM screening tool. All PLHIV should thereafter be re-screened every six months (see Figure 43).

<a id='89ccd285-977e-49f4-83b4-d5ba24111760'></a>

### Treatment For DM

HIV-positive patients with DM should be treated as per the treatment protocol (see Figure 44) adopted from the Uganda Clinical Guidelines. However, the following should be observed:

*   Reinforce lifestyle interventions at every clinic visit (refer to section 1.1.4)
*   Healthy heart diet
*   Adequate exercise (at least 30 minutes per day or 150 minutes per week)

* Weight loss/management
* Cessation of smoking
* Elimination/reduction of alcohol consumption
* Advise on foot care for all diabetics to prevent wounds/ulcers from developing.
* Metabolically neutral ARVs should be prescribed for patients at risk of developing DM. These include ABC, TDF and 3TC.
* Exclude HIV-associated nephropathy and liver toxicity before initiating metformin because it may lead to Metformin Associated Lactic Acidosis (MALA).
* HIV patients on metformin should be educated about the symptoms of lactic acidosis, including fatigue, weight loss, nausea, abdominal pain, dyspnea, and arrhythmia. Liver-related symptoms such as tender hepatomegaly, edema, ascites, and encephalopathy may occur, but jaundice is uncommon.
* The gastrointestinal side effects of metformin are increased in patients with HIV enteropathy. Metformin should, therefore, be started at a low dose and increased gradually.
* Lopinavir/r, ATV/r, and DRV/r can be used with close monitoring.
* DTG should not be used.

## Risk factors for obesity

Although there are genetic, behavioural, metabolic and hormonal influences on body weight, obesity occurs when you take in more calories than you burn through normal daily activities and exercise. The risk factors that can be modified include; an unhealthy diet i.e high in calories, lacking in fruits and vegetables, b. inactivity: Sedentary lifestyle, c. Stress, d. some medical conditions can lead to weight gain

## 5.4.7.2 Screening, Diagnosis and Management of Hypertension

All PLHIV should be screened for risk factors of hypertension such as tobacco smoking, being overweight or obese, physical inactivity, dyslipidemia, history of adverse cardiovascular event like stroke and heart attack and unhealthy diet at every visit. They should also have their blood pressure (BP) measurement at every clinic visit. Note that protease inhibitors can also contribute to increased cardiovascular disease risk. Persistently high resting BP defined as >140/90mmHg on at least two measurements five minutes apart with the patient seated should be managed as guided by the algorithm (Figure 47). People with any risk factor identified should be advised to modify lifestyle as described below.

## Figure 48: Lifestyle Modification Counselling for Hypertension

### Lifestyle Counselling
*   **Tobacco smoking cessation**: Ceasing to smoke reduces the risk of, uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, stroke and chronic lung diseases.
*   **Regular physical activity**: Persons should be advised to have aerobic exercises for at least 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week. Health care workers should help patients find activities that they enjoy because this increases adherence.
*   **Healthy diet**: Eat a diet high in fruits and vegetables and low in fat
    *   Limit processed and fast foods.
    *   Reduce refined sugar intake.
*   **Salt reduction**: Reduce sodium intake to <1.5 g/day (less than one teaspoon)
*   **Weight control**: Maintain a normal body weight of a body mass index of 18 – 25kg/m² and or a waist circumference of < 82cm for females and < 102cm for males.

<a id='0be0149a-6672-4fd6-a13a-adeec2765aff'></a>

Adherence counselling for integrated HIV
Hypertension and diabetes Care

*   The goal of treatment is blood pressure <140/90mmHg, Diabetes is FBG < 7mmol/l and viral load< 200copies/ml
*   Patients with uncontrolled hypertension and blood sugar may suffer complication such as heart attack, stroke, chronic kidney disease, blindness, numbness of limbs and heart failure,
*   Hypertension, diabetes and HIV/ART treatment is lifelong.
*   Hypertension often has no symptoms, HIV patients with unsuppressed viral loads may initially show no symptoms but they will appear in the worst form and those with high blood sugar will show symptoms immediately
*   ART, diabetes and hypertension medicines can be taken at the same time.
*   Maintain lifestyle modification and risk reduction with treatment.
*   Adherence to ARTminimizes complications of HIV infection on the blood vessels.
*   Explain potential side effects of hypertension medicines.

**Drug-Drug interactions and common side effects of some of the NCD drugs**

PLHIV with co-morbidities often take multiple drugs some of which interact and may increase or decrease each other's level affecting the outcome. It is important that a health worker pays attention to the different types of drugs a patient is receiving. This way there will be minimal effect on the outcome and less side effects (see tables 57 and 58).

**Management of Clinic Reviews for Stable HIV Patients with NCDs**

HIV patients with diabetes and hypertension often have to attend separate HIV and NCD clinics on different days of the month. This comes at a cost to the patient; time off work, transport costs to the health facility and often affects their adherence to either ARVs or NCD drugs. Therefore:
a. Stable HIV patients with NCDs and without any complications should be given same clinic appointment and seen by the same clinician (where possible).
b. Provide comprehensive health education sessions that is inclusive of both HIV and NCD information during the clinic.
c. Manage the patients' records/charts in the same location for easier access and retrieval when needed.
d. Patients who develop NCD-related complications should be referred to higher level/specialists for further management.

5.4.7.3 Assessment and Management of Common Mental
Disorders Amongst PLHIV

<a id='b6b9d46e-1fb5-4ce3-bbce-00e86dad09b1'></a>

## Assessment and management of depression

PLHIV are at risk of mental and neurological disorders. About 10–20% of PLHIV have major depression. PLHIV with mental health disorder are less likely to achieve optimal ART adherence and could have poor treatment outcomes. Assessing and managing the most common mental illnesses among people living with HIV is important and should be an integral part of HIV care programs.

<a id='60bed5eb-9422-4169-9bdd-4d8f73015ca4'></a>

## Screening for depression, anxiety, substance and alcohol use disorder

Clinicians should screen for depression and anxiety as part of the routine mental health assessment and when symptoms suggest its presence. It is particularly important to screen for depression and anxiety during the following crisis points:

*   When newly diagnosed with HIV or at disclosure of HIV status to family and friends.
*   Occurrence of any physical illness, recognition of new symptoms/progression of disease or hospitalization or diagnosis of AIDS.
*   Initiation of medication.
*   Death of a significant other.
*   Necessity of making end of life and permanency planning decisions.
*   Major life changes,e.g., childbirth, pregnancy, loss of a job, end of a relationship.

<a id='d3f8c93b-a791-4c1e-aa1c-32d40cf55c7e'></a>

Procedure for Mental Health assessment at TRIAGE

**Procedure for mental Health assessment of Triage**

* General health education on common Mental Health disorders to all attending patients.
* Educate about the signs & symptoms of common mental health disorders.
* Identify and sort out patients that report any of the signs & symptoms.
* Set up a private corner at triage point.
* Use the screening tools provided to assess the patients individually.
* Ensure the triage nurse/ peer is well trained to screen for Mental health.
* Use language which is most comfortable and understandable for the patient.
* Document in the patient file

# Management of Alcohol and Substance Use Disorder

Motivational interviewing (brief intervention) for alcohol and substance use:

* Provide personalized feedback to the person about the risks associated with their pattern of substance use
* Encourage the person to take responsibility for their substance use choices, and the choice of whether to seek assistance for their substance use.
* Ask the person the reasons for their substance use
* Ask about their perception of both the positive and negative consequences of their substance use
* Ask about the person's personal goals, and whether their substance use is helping them or preventing them from reaching these goals.
* Have a discussion with the person based on the statements about their substance use, its causes, consequences, and their personal goals, allowing exploration of apparent inconsistencies between the consequences of substance use and the person's stated goals.
* Discuss options for change based on the choice of realistic goals and try to find a mutually agreed course of action.
* Support the person to enact these changes by communicating your confidence in them to make positive changes in their life
