6. ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV

<a id='fd936011-d520-40d8-805d-4fe895e7b978'></a>

## 6.1 THE GOAL OF ART

The aim of antiretroviral therapy is to suppress viral load levels amongst PLHIV to undetectable levels, reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality associated with HIV, and reduce transmission of HIV.

<a id='b8c5317d-2b6d-4df6-b700-b98e81920cc0'></a>

## 6.2 COMPOSITION OF ART

Standard ART consists of a combination of at least 3 antiretroviral (ARV) drugs to maximally suppress the HIV and stop the spread of HIV/AIDS disease. ART regimens usually comprise a "Backbone" of 2 Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) and a 3rd "Anchor" ARV from another class (including Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitors, Protease Inhibitors, Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors).

<a id='0b3292eb-10fe-4843-bdfa-35e3d0c071cb'></a>

6.3 WHEN TO START ART
ART should be initiated at the earliest opportunity in all people with
confirmed HIV infection, regardless of clinical stage or CD4 cell count.

<a id='5b8354e9-f618-45ca-a193-e3705163e96c'></a>

**Rationale for treating all people living with HIV**

Since 2013, evidence and programmatic experience have continued to favour early initiation of ART because it results in reduced mortality, morbidity, and HIV transmission outcomes.

<a id='803d1036-c394-4c3d-9f3e-badcebcd4791'></a>

## 6.4 THE PROCESS OF STARTING ART
Although the program recommends starting all PLHIV on ART, health workers should do the following:
* Assess all clients with the Symptom Screen for Advanced Disease Pathway (Figure 33) any evidence of opportunistic infections (OIs) especially TB and cryptococcal meningitis. If the patient has TB or cryptococcal meningitis, ART should be deferred and initiated after starting treatment

<a id='dfb5dd48-32ab-41d5-b9b3-7473a164029d'></a>

for these OIs as outlined in Chapter 7. Treatment for other OIs and ART can be initiated concurrently.

* For patients without TB or cryptococcal meningitis, offer ART on the same day through an opt-out approach. In this approach, patients should be prepared for ART on the same day according to the guidelines in Section 7.5.2 and assessed for readiness to start ART using the readiness checklist (Table 64).
* If a client is ready, ART should be initiated on the same day. If a client is not ready or opts out of same-day initiation, a timely ART preparation plan should be agreed upon with the aim of initiating ART within seven days for children and pregnant women, and within one month for adults. See Figure 56 for the process of evaluating patients for ART.
* For institutions starting patients on ARTS for research purposes, there should be a clear post ART access plane for approved drugs but not yet accessible in the public facilities
* Post-Trial Access: Research institutions should collaboratively work with its partners to ensure post trial/Research access to efficacious/safe study HIV treatment regimens for HIV positive clients enrolled for study purposes until the drugs become available through the national supply chain. If the patients can afford prescribed ART regimens but are not available on the essential drugs list and not accessible through the national supply chain system, facilitate access to options of these new generation drugs

## 6.5 FIRST-LINE ART REGIMENS FOR PATIENTS INITIATING ART

Principles for selecting the ARV regimens (treatment optimization):

The first-line ART regimens for treating HIV infection in Uganda were selected based on the universal principles:

*   Toxicity: regimens with less toxicity are preferred.
*   Palatability and pill burden; better palatability and lower pill burden preferred.
*   Increased durability and efficacy.
*   Sequencing: spares other available formulations for use in the 2nd line regimen.
*   Harmonization of regimen across age and population.
*   Lower cost.

<a id='5e27fb18-f5aa-42e9-827d-910f7e5da7a5'></a>

DOLUTEGRAVIR (DTG) is an integrase inhibitor and is recommended
for use as the anchor ARV in the preferred first, second- and third-line
treatment regimens for all recipients of care such as children, adolescents,
men, women including pregnant women, breastfeeding women, adolescent
girls and women of childbearing potential).

<a id='852a3393-8873-4004-a8a0-949a87630aee'></a>

**RATIONALE FOR USING DOLUTEGRAVIR (DTG)**
a. High Circulating levels of resistance to NNRTI-containing First-line Therapy
NNRTI-containing combinations have been used as first-line regimens for adults in Uganda since the start of ART services in 2005. However, there are growing concerns of increasing levels of transmitted drug resistance, mostly to NNRTIs, in Uganda and elsewhere. A study by the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) conducted in Uganda in 2016/2017 revealed high levels of pre-treatment drug resistance (PDR) estimated at 15.9% to NNRTIs, exceeding the threshold of 10.0% set by WHO for first line ARVs.

<a id='b260592d-9baf-49a7-96ef-edb6446e4626'></a>

b. Superior Efficacy over Current Standard of Care Regimens
DTG is superior to alternative ARV options and patients can experience rapid viral suppression, thereby reducing risk of transmitting HIV while prolonging time on first-line treatment. It has been shown that patients who receive DTG achieve viral suppression faster as compared to those who receive EFV.

<a id='84b69ea2-dd24-42bf-98c7-1576f0942ba7'></a>

c. Better Tolerability
DTG shows improved tolerability versus current preferred regimens with substantial reductions in treatment-limiting adverse drug reactions. Specifically, patients can avoid some of the psychiatric adverse events of EFV (ie depression and suicidal tendencies). Overall, in country and WHO evidence supports DTG as a highly tolerated medicine that is less likely to result in treatment discontinuation.

d. Higher genetic barrier to resistance
The higher genetic barrier of DTG means patients are less likely to develop resistance and therefore postponing the need for superior line treatment

<a id='0be4bd1e-3d7b-45ae-9714-4a12cdb019e7'></a>

## 6.6 SCREENING FOR RISK FACTORS PRIOR TO INITIATING DGT

DTG is a very well-tolerated drug, with lower overall adverse effects when compared to other drugs like EFV. Hyperglycemia among previously non-diabetic adults and worsening of hyperglycemia among diabetics has been reported among clients on DTG. Although the hyperglycemia associated with DTG has been reported among clients newly initiated on ART as well as among those already on ART and transitioned to DTG-based regimens, the hyperglycemia appears to occur more commonly among the latter group. Adults being initiated on DTG should be screened for risk factors for hyperglycemia:

<a id='52541cda-f864-465d-9129-e2eb44472fda'></a>

*   Age ≥ 40 years
*   BMI≥ 24 kg/m2
*   History of hypertension
*   Known diabetics should not be initiated or transitioned to DTG. Give an EFV400 or an ATV/r-based regimen.
*   Clients with 2 or more risk factors for hyperglycemia and a high baseline RBS or FBS should not be initiated/transitioned to DTG. Give an EFV400 or ATZ/r-based regimen.
*   Clients with 2 or more risk factors for hyperglycemia with normal baseline RBS or FBS: Initiate or transition to DTG and monitor RBS or FBS every 3 months for 6 months.

### 6.6.1 Rationale for Using EFV400

Studies have shown that efavirenz at a dose of 400 mg is not only virologically non-inferior to Efavirenz 600mg but also has fewer adverse events which is the major limiting factor of efavirenz use. Fewer adverse events lower the risk of treatment discontinuation. EFV 400 mg can be co-administered with Rifampicin-containing anti-TB treatment, with co-administration well tolerated and plasma concentrations maintained above the levels considered to be effective. EFV400 is recommended for use as an alternative first line anchor ARV when DTG is contraindicated.

**PREGNANT AND BREASTFEEDING WOMEN ALREADY ON FIRST LINE ART**

Do viral load test at the 1st ANC/PNC visit:
1. If already on TDF or TAF +3TC+EFV and stable with suppressed VL, maintain on TDF or TAF +3TC+EFV400 until 6-9 months postpartum and then transition to TDF or TAF +3TC+DTG if VL within past 6 months is suppressed.
2. If already on TDF or TAF +3TC+DTG and stable with suppressed VL, maintain this regimen.
3. If on a first line regimen containing NVP, ABC or AZT and VL at ANC 1 is suppressed, maintain same regimen and switch to TDF or TAF +3TC+DTG at 6-9 months postpartum if VL within past 6 months is suppressed.
4. Note: In the case of a pregnant or breastfeeding woman on Abacavir consider the possibility that she was given the Abacavir because of a contraindication to Tenofovir. Screen the women carefully for eligibility for TDF before initiating TLD.

All HIV-infected children weighing less than 20kg should be initiated on Abacavir + Lamivudine + Dolutegravir (ABC + 3TC + DTG)
(Table 74)

If DTG is contra-indicated, initiate on Abacavir + Lamivudine+ Ritonavir-boosted Lopinavir (ABC+3TC+LPV/r).
LPV/r syrup, pellets or tablets should be prescribed/dispensed on the basis of the individual child's ABILITY to CORRECTLY take the specific formulation. As soon as the child is able to take pellets, these will be prescribed instead of syrup. Likewise, as soon as a child is able to swallow tablets without breaking, crushing or chewing them, these will be prescribed instead of pellets.

6.12 MONITORING RESPONSE TO ART

This chapter provides guidance on how to and when to use clinical assessment and laboratory monitoring tests to monitor response to ART, ART side effects and toxicity, and how to diagnose ART treatment failure. The purpose of monitoring patients on ART is to assess:
* Response to ART and diagnose treatment failure
* Safety of the medicines- side effects and toxicity.
* Adherence to ART

<a id='61f2c9c1-a147-457d-b119-171229dcbf14'></a>

Monitoring adherence to ART is covered in Chapter 11. The visit schedule

### 6.12.2 Laboratory Monitoring

#### Viral load monitoring

Uganda adopted viral load monitoring as the preferred approach for monitoring response to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and to diagnose/ confirm ART treatment failure, defined as two consecutive viral load results of >1,000 copies/mL. Compared to clinical or immunological monitoring,

Consolidated Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of HIV and Aids in Uganda - 2022

<a id='def1cbd4-4214-4c34-b1b0-413bac3bea72'></a>

virological monitoring provides an early and more accurate indication of treatment failure and indicates the need to switch from first line to second-line drugs, and from second- line to third-line drugs, toward reducing accumulation of drug-resistance mutations and improved clinical outcomes.

<a id='8355437f-fbc9-488f-8c8b-286b520adeac'></a>

Dolutegravir (DTG)-based regimens (e.g., tenofovir/lamivudine/dolutegravir
[TLD]) have increased viral load suppression (VLS) rates to unprecedented
levels, hence a need to actively monitor patients for low-level viremia to keep
DTG a durable treatment option for as long as possible.

<a id='ee25106f-5634-4c62-a4df-2813522a4d6d'></a>

Furthermore, low-level viraemia monitoring can enhances monitoring
of achieving and sustaining HIV epidemic control, as viral load of >200
copies/mL is associated with potential risk of sexual transmission as well as
subsequent virologic non-suppression and treatment failure.

<a id='ca64f2ab-80ad-43ea-906d-4f8e67f71390'></a>

Given the above background and taking into consider the 2021 World Health Organization guidance to monitor low-level viremia, the guidelines have been designed to carter for health facilities with capacity to utilize plasma and dried blood spot (DBS) samples at suppression cut off points of 200 copies/ mL and 400 copies/mL respectively, as shown in Figure 58.

<a id='bd00515c-8749-413c-af4b-588e0b552bc4'></a>

A patient who has been on ART for more than 6 months and is responding
to ART is considered virally suppressed at VL <200 copies/mL and <400
copies/mL for plasma and DBS samples, respectively. Facilities should
constitute a multidisciplinary VL review committees to review, track, and
make decisions to optimize ART regimen by switching to second-line, third-
line, or a more potent regimen. At the minimum, the committee should
consist of a healthcare worker and a lay provider (e.g. expert client, counselor,
peer education, VHT) who knows the client.

<a id='6c4d0418-f463-4f17-8d78-a8a49d5b8c64'></a>

## 6.12.3 Frequency of viral load monitoring
1. Children and adolescents under 19 years of age: the first VL test should be done at 6 and 12 months after initiating ART, if it is suppressed, every 6 months thereafter. If not suppressed, follow the algorithm in Figure 58.
2. Adults: the first VL test should be done 6 months after initiation of ART. The second VL following the first suppressed viral load should be done at 12 months after initiation of ART and thereafter every 12 months if it is suppressed. If not suppressed, follow the algorithm in Figure 58.
3. HIV positive pregnant and breastfeeding women: If newly initiated on ART at ANC, conduct a VL test at 3 months on ART. If VL supressed

4. repeat VL every 3 months throughout pregnancy and until cessation of breastfeeding. If not suppressed, follow the algorithm in Figure 58. HIV-positive pregnant and breastfeeding women already on ART at ANC1 or MBCP: If HIV+ woman is already on ART at ANC1 or enrolled at MBCP, conduct a VL test at first ANC or MBCP visit. If VL is supressed repeat VL every 3 months throughout pregnancy until cessation of breastfeeding. If not suppressed, follow the algorithm in Figure 58.
5. After every switch in treatment (after failure): The VL test should be done at 6 months after a switch to second- and third-line ART.
6. Third line ART patients: The VL test should be done every 6 months. If VL is un-suppressed, then genotype testing is recommended.

For PLHIV with non-suppressed viral load, the following 10- point package should be applied in all health facilities:
1. Engage multidisciplinary switch team at health facilities to discuss failing patients.
2. Sort viral load results from the laboratory as suppressed vs non-suppressed (NS) for rapid action by the ART clinic.

3. Apply the red stickers for non-suppressed clients to flag non-suppressed client files.
4. Conduct a first intensive adherence counselling within 7-30 days of result return.
5. Record IAC sessions on HIV care card to support completion of 3 consecutive IAC sessions.
6. Form viral load focal teams with clinical-lab interface for routine review of non-suppressed files.
7. Utilization of non-suppressed registers.
8. Integrate viral load monitoring talks into routine health education sessions.
9. Linkage with community structures for peer support and client tracking.
10. VL CQI site-level initiatives for managing non-suppressed patients.

## Genotype testing

HIV genotypic resistance test is a qualitative test that detects mutations associated with ARV drug resistance. The test evaluates if the HIV strain infecting the individual has developed resistance to one or more ARV drugs. This is useful in identifying a combination of ARVs to which the HIV strain is susceptible. There is documented high level of pre-treatment drug resistance to Nevirapine and Efavirenz in Uganda (15.4% in the general population and 35.7% among infants of HIV infected mothers).

<a id='8f9982fa-eec0-4d12-8f49-96b9c9bd5511'></a>

As a priority, eligible PLHIV on non-DTG based regimens should be transitioned to DTG and monitored appropriately. In the era of DTG as an anchor drug with high resistance barrier, genotype testing is the recommended approach for PLHIV switching from one regimen to a superior regimen after 3-consecutive IAC with scores ≥95% and a non-suppressed repeat VL.

<a id='a8cf5f35-71c6-4015-a37e-8ba661522096'></a>

CD4 monitoring

CD4 cell count testing can be performed using point of care technologies
such as laboratory based CD4 analyzers and device -free semi-quantitative
rapid tests. If a CD4 cell count is not readily available onsite, draw a sample
and send to the nearby hub laboratory for testing.

<a id='7d81f85a-75ed-4448-af51-517aaf60b54a'></a>

CD4 cell count is recommended in the following scenarios:

* At baseline when initiating ART; Baseline CD4 helps to screen for risk for opportunistic infections, e.g. cryptococcal infection in patients with CD4 less than 200 cells/mm3.

## 6.13 PHARMACOVIGILANCE

Pharmacovigilance (PV) is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO,
2006) as the science and activities relating to the detection, assessment,
understanding, and prevention of adverse effects of medicines or any other
medicine related problem.

<a id='653e8b79-8fed-4d40-834f-dffa0a40b2c0'></a>

This section recommends heightened pharmacovigilance, re-emphasizes
the systems in place for reporting and monitoring drug safety.

<a id='2c392c74-e37d-4281-ba11-c7492986cf4c'></a>

**IMPORTANT OF PV**

Approval of new medicines for use is based on the information from the pre-approval studies. However, these studies cannot identify all the possible adverse outcomes that a drug may cause, and several unexpected side effects manifest during clinical use which must be monitored, and managed. Health workers must therefore make effort to monitor/detect, understand causes, report, manage and mitigate these reactions (pharmacovigilance).

<a id='6c795138-7bca-46d7-acf9-1b3a827dd797'></a>

Toxicities may occur at any time during treatment. Toxicities or adverse drug reactions refer to unintended harmful events due to exposure to medicines. They may be mild to severe and should be anticipated and monitored in a timely manner to avoid severe morbidity and mortality outcomes. Adverse drug reactions may negatively affect treatment uptake, adherence and retention in care.

<a id='e7529b22-57c4-447c-8a6a-911687262eab'></a>

**MAJOR AIMS OF PV**

a. Early detection of previously unknown adverse reactions and interactions.
b. Detection of increase in known adverse drug reactions.
c. Identification of predisposing risk factors and possible mechanisms underlying adverse reaction.
d. Estimation of quantitative aspects of risk/ benefits analysis and dissemination of needed information to improve drug prescribing, use and regulation.

<a id='094a66e3-8ad9-47ca-a913-4210ccf419ca'></a>

## METHODS OF PV

There are different methods of PV which include Spontaneous reporting and Active pharmacovigilance however, the method approved for HIV and TB implementing site is active pharmacovigilance.

<a id='a2d98f08-b32b-4ac3-bb5f-0d1b4e910044'></a>

Figure 63: Steps and key players in Pharmacovigilance
<::flowchart: PV in action: Operational flow
The flowchart illustrates a circular process with the following steps:
1.  "Ask Patient at HF about ADR" (Healthcare Worker/Counselor vs Patient)
2.  "HW Documents" (Healthcare Worker/Counselor documents in the PV tool)
3.  "HW Reports to HF PV focal person" (Facility PV Focal Person)
4.  "Analyze" (Submit to NDA, NDA/ACP/NTLP)
5.  "Feedback" (To stakeholders including MOH)
The flow proceeds clockwise, indicated by arrows between each step.::>
Flow of information
Patient---> HCW/counselors--->PV focal person at facility---> designated NDA/ACP focal person---> Data aggregation ---> Data
analysis ---> Trends are reported back to the field, program, global bodies

<a id='a7ed37e7-ab14-48bc-8517-41ed43a98011'></a>

**PHARMACOVIGILANCE STRATEGY FOR THE ART PROGRAM**
**IN UGANDA**

The program adopted active PV as part of the routine standard of care in all HIV and TB facilities. The strategy for active PV implementation shall apply in all HIV and TB clinics, and will include:
* Screening for any suspected ADRs as per screening tool at triage area
* Clinical evaluation of the reported signs and symptoms
* Baseline Laboratory screening to detect the presence or absence of adverse drug reactions

<a id='cb9fe1aa-2a01-4a49-abc1-f485125d8edd'></a>

- Routine Laboratory screening for adverse drug reactions to monitor ARV and TB drug toxicities to better understand the risks of taking the drug regimen under conditions of programmatic use
- Management of severity of adverse drug events in a timely manner
- Systematic and standardized recording and reporting of AEs

<a id='4cbf631c-c540-4753-a313-852d8fdb9acc'></a>

## ACTIVE PHARMACOVIGILANCE

Active PV, in contrast to spontaneous PV, seeks to ascertain completely the extent of adverse events through a continuous systematic process. To complement spontaneous reporting, active PV enables enhanced monitoring & data capture of ADRs including management of adverse events for improved treatment outcomes.

<a id='5ef5ff23-ad8b-4b81-8f83-6dc728e8c5bc'></a>

The processes of Active PV implementation will be as follows:

a. All RRHs, some District Hospitals and centres of excellency that act as HUBs for delivery of active PV services shall be sentinel sites for active PV services delivery.
b. Sentinel sites shall pro-actively follow-up patients to detect drug reactions and, conduct the following laboratory screening for all Recipients of Care (RoC):
   i) Baseline laboratory investigations for suspected adverse drug event in addition to clinical screening as per the guidelines
   ii) Routine laboratory investigations for suspected or confirmed adverse drug event in addition to clinical screening as per the guidelines
   iii) Both laboratory and clinical screenings shall be conducted for patients during treatment to detect ADRs and AEs even when the patient has no signs and symptoms
c. Non- sentinel sites (Spokes) shall conduct risk-based screening to determine what laboratory tests are to be done. For patients who screen positive to a minimum of two questions on the screening tool shall be eligible for relevant laboratory tests.
   i) Samples for relevant laboratory tests to investigate for suspected adverse drug events shall be transported to the nearby Hub using laboratory Hub transport system
d. For each encounter, the health worker should screen for any suspected ADRs as per screening tool above at triage.
e. Clinicians should further evaluate reported signs and symptoms.
f. Where applicable the clinician should request for additional tests (including laboratory and radiological) for patients with signs or symptoms suggesting ADRs.

g. Routine Screening for active PV: Clinicians/ Health workers shall request for tests at baseline and periodically thereafter as described in Table 64 below.
h. All AEs detected should be managed according to severity in accordance to the guidelines
i. All suspected ADRs should be recorded on the relevant tools: Patient care cards, Registers, entered in eMRS, and aDSM report form. All suspected ADRs/AEs data should be reviewed at the site by the facility pharmacovigilance team. The aDSM report form should be relayed to the NDA either online or as a hard copy (Annex 15).
j. Data on ADRs and AEs from ART and TB medicines should regularly be analyzed by the NDA to inform regulatory decision and stakeholders feedback in quarterly aDSM technical working group meetings.

Procedure of reporting an adverse drug reaction
Figure 64: Showing reporting process of adverse drug reaction
<::flowchart::>
This flowchart illustrates the reporting process of adverse drug reactions, moving through four main stages in a cyclical manner.

**Stage 1: Responsibility**
*   For each encounter, ALL HWs should screen for suspected ADRs using the Drug Safety Screening checklist.

**Stage 2: What to Report**
*   All suspected ADRs (whether mild or severe) should be recorded into the various HMIS tools; ART Cards, Registers, eMRS, reviewed and reported.

**Stage 3: When to Report**
*   Serious AES: Within 24-48 hrs. of notification.
*   Non-serious events: As soon as possible but not later than 15 days.
*   Routine reporting in HMIS and electronic tools advised.

**Stage 4: How to Report**
*   Monthly on HMIS 105 ADRs from PrEP and PMTCT.
*   Quarterly on HMIS 106a for all other ADRs.
*   aDSM report to NDA should be via any of the platforms below:
    *   Email: druginfo@nda.or.ug
    *   WhatsApp: 0740002070
    *   Toll Free: 0800101999
    *   Hard copy forms delivered to any of the NDA offices.

The flow indicates a progression from Responsibility to What to Report, then to When to Report, then to How to Report, and finally loops back to Responsibility, suggesting a continuous process.
<::>

<a id='c5e3db5f-c04e-4732-ad35-ea04f916da09'></a>

As soon as an ADR is suspected/detected, health worker should:
* Immediately and adequately assess the patient for adverse drug events/ reactions
* Record the diagnosis in the client care card, OPD/IPD register and eMRS.
* Fill the aDSM report form, collect all the filled forms, tally, and enter the record into relevant registers, and reported into HMIS database that include; HMIS Form 105 for ADR from PrEP and PMTCT and HMIS Form 106a for all other ADRs
* The suspected ADR should concurrently be recorded on the Active Drug Safety Monitoring (aDSM) form in Annex 15. The aDSM form should be filled in duplicates; - Original copy submitted to the National Pharmacovigilance Centre at the NDA secretariat, the duplicate (blue

* Ensure relevant tests are conducted
* The report is then submitted to the pharmacovigilance focal person within the facility, or if no such person exists, to the regional referral within your catchment area or to the nearest NDA office, or directly to the national Pharmacovigilance Centre at the NDA head office
* For reports on serious adverse events, within 24 to 48 hours of detection/ diagnosis.
* For non-serious adverse events report as soon as possible but, in any case, not later than 15 days.
* Follow up of the ADR should be done appropriately and any emerging supplementary/additional information should be forwarded immediately.

The tally data for the previous month (collected from HMIS 105 and HMIS 108) should be entered into the HMIS database. NB: --- Use a separate form for each event.

## 6.14 COMMON DRUG TOXICITIES IN HIV CARE

Antiretroviral drugs and other drugs used in HIV care can cause a wide range of toxicities, from low-grade intolerance that may be self-limiting to life-threatening side effects. Differentiating between ART toxicity (also known as adverse reactions) and complications of HIV disease is sometimes difficult. An observed toxicity could be due to a concurrent infectious process or due to a reaction to medications other than ARVs such as Isoniazid–induced hepatitis in a child on treatment for TB or a rash induced by Cotrimoxazole.

<a id='2f6443dd-807e-4180-89b9-45703062f3d5'></a>

Drug-related side effects while on ART can occur immediately (soon after a drug has been administered), early (within the first days or weeks of treatment) or late (after months or years of treatment). Adverse reactions may be specific to a particular drug, or they may be generic to the class of drugs in use. Toxicity is a concern because it can be life-threatening, can cause non-adherence to ARVs, and may be disfiguring like lipodystrophy. See Table 78 for common ARV side effects and toxicities.

<a id='71ff37d4-8a4c-4b0e-932e-42df50cf0052'></a>

Managing ARV and TB Drug Toxicity

Healthcare workers should assess patients on ART and TB medicines for side effects and toxicities at every clinic visit. If the patient has side effects or toxicity do the following:

- Determine the seriousness of the toxicity.
- Evaluate concurrent medications and establish whether the toxicity may be attributable to an ARV or TB medicine, or to any other medication taken at the same time.
- Consider other disease processes. Not all problems that arise during treatment are caused bymedicines.
- Manage the side effects and toxicities according to severity (Table 85).
- Report the event using the Adverse Drug Reaction form.

**Drug substitutions for ARV drug toxicity**

Substitution is the process of replacing one ARV drug with another. The duration on ART is important when doing ARV substitution. If substitutions are being done within six months of starting ART, it is not necessary to perform a viral load test.

<a id='93f0f624-0c38-4ea2-8409-9fe377cdcfb3'></a>

However, after six months on ART, a viral load test may be required to rule out treatment failure before a drug is substituted in a failing patient. If the viral load is not suppressed, it is possible the patient may be failing on treatment. Follow the viral load algorithm to rule out treatment failure. In a failing patient, the ART regimen should be switched to 2nd line. See Table 78 for side effects of commonly used ARVs and recommended substitutions.

<a id='8cd8eba6-7afe-4ce1-b17f-fce090bd2ee4'></a>

**HEPATOTOXICITY FOLLOWING CO-ADMINISTRATION OF ART AND TPT /TB MEDICINES**

Co-administration of ART and TPT/TB medicines increases the likelihood of toxicities especially hepatotoxicity. Health workers should therefore take care to adequately screen patients for TPT eligibility prior to initiation of TPT. Once toxicity occurs, it should be managed appropriately according to the grading (refer to Table 86 for grading).

<a id='7c75498d-e271-4467-aefc-486cfd8cbac2'></a>

**Contraindication for TPT:**
* Presence of acute liver disease
* History of alcohol abuse
* Known hypersentivity to INH
* Presence of mental illness
* Presence of seizures
* Presence of severe neuropathy
* Newly initiated on DTG (within the last 3 months)

<a id='7df556b0-50cf-4133-adb5-e7c3022f6f96'></a>

Co-administration with Nevirapine. Note, for patients transitioning from NVP, ensure to wait for at least 2 weeks before starting TPT.

Box 11: Key highlights in Pharmacovigilance

* These guidelines emphasize the importance of pharmacovigilance for the early identification and management of adverse effects of medications especially HIV and TB medicines.
* Method of pharmacovigilance adopted for all HIV and TB facilities shall be Active pharmacovigilance.
* All facilities, as part of routine care should routinely screen, investigate, manage and report adverse drug reactions as they present at the facility. Healthcare workers should assess patients on HIV and TB medicines for side effects and toxicities at every clinic visit.
* Active pharmacovigilance involves pro-active investigation of patients during treatment and follows them up to detect adverse drug reactions and adverse events even when the patient has no signs or symptoms.
* All suspected ADRs (whether mild or severe) should be recorded into the various HMIS tools; ART Cards, Registers, eMRS, reviewed and reported.
* Reports from active PV should be submitted to the National Drug Authority through the Regional Referral Hospital and NDA Regional Offices.
* Side effects and toxicities of ARVs and TB medicines should be managed according to severity. For moderate and severe reactions, the responsible ARV or TB medicine should be substituted following the specific substitution guidance. For life-threatening reactions, ART and/or TB medication should be discontinued, and the event managed. ART and TB medication should be resumed with substitution of the responsible ARV or TB medication when the patient is stable.

## WHAT TO EXPECT IN THE FIRST MONTHS OF ART

Although ART is a lifelong commitment, the first months of therapy are especially important.

* Clinical and immunological improvement and viral suppression are expected when individuals adhere to ART.
* Opportunistic infections (OIs) and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) may develop, as well as early adverse drug reactions, such as drug hypersensitivity, especially in the first three months of treatment.
* ART significantly decreases mortality overall, but death rates are also highest in the first three months of ART. These complications are most common when the people starting ART already have advanced HIV

disease with severe immunodeficiency and existing coinfections and/or comorbidities, severely low hemoglobin, low body mass index, and very low CD4 cell counts or are severely malnourished.
* More frequent visits and monitoring can help reduce this mortality.
* Poor adherence in this period is also associated with the risk of early treatment failure and rapid development of drug resistance.

IMMUNE RECONSTITUTION INFLAMMATORY SYNDROME
(IRIS)

IRIS is a spectrum of clinical signs and symptoms thought to be associated with immune recovery brought about by a response to ART. It is a widely recognized phenomenon that occurs among 10–30% of the people initiating ART, usually within the first 4–8 weeks after initiating therapy. IRIS should be considered only when the presentation cannot be explained by a new infection, the expected course of a known infection, or drug toxicity. The most serious and life-threatening forms of IRIS occur in patients co-infected with TB, Cryptococcus, Kaposi's sarcoma and herpes zoster. BCG vaccine–associated IRIS (localized and systemic) may occur in infants infected with HIV in settings where BCG immunization is routine.

<a id='755ebbf1-7b55-4a6e-8120-277fd2ee59e2'></a>

Risk factors for IRIS include a low CD4+ cell count (<50 cells/mm3) at ART initiation, disseminated opportunistic infections or tumors and/or a shorter duration of therapy for opportunistic infections before ART starts.

<a id='0abdeb49-c62e-4947-af16-b1101beef4ee'></a>

## Managing IRIS

IRIS is generally self-limiting, and interruption of ART is rarely indicated. Treat any co-infections to reduce morbidity and symptoms. If the symptoms are protracted, reassure the patient to prevent discontinuation of, or poor adherence to ART.

<a id='9d504525-c657-4eb8-8d77-49265b77803f'></a>

**Steps to reduce development of IRIS**
1. Diagnose HIV early and initiate ART before CD4 declines to below 200 cells/mm3.
2. Screen and optimally manage opportunistic infections before initiating ART, especially TB and Cryptococcus.
3. The timing of ART in people with opportunistic infections requires balancing a greater risk of IRIS after early initiation against continuing high mortality if ART is delayed.

6.15 CHILDREN WITH A NON-SUPPRESSED VIRAL
LOAD

If the child is on an NNRTI regimen and VL is not suppressed, switch to
2nd line immediately and do IAC simultaneously. Do not postpone switch.

If the child is on a DTG or LPV/r-based first line ART regimen, conduct
IAC and repeat VL after 3 months. DTG and PI have high resistance barrier
so poor adherence is a more likely cause for an unsuppressed VL than
resistance. If VL is still not suppressed after IAC interventions, conduct HIV
drug resistance to guide the next cause of action.

RECOMMENDED 2ndline REGIMEN:
2NRTIs + DTG
(if client failed on a PI- or NNRTI-based 1st line ART regimen)
or 2 NRTIs + ATV/r
(if client failed on a DTG-based or NNRTI-based 1st-line ART regimen)
The choice of NRTI should be determined based on the NRTI the patient

regimens see Table 63

<a id='1d6f3fd5-96fa-4cae-a06f-513173974c17'></a>

## Rationale for using ATV/r

Atazanavir is preferred over LPV/r because it offers an option of once daily dosing with lower pill burden and better GI tolerability as compared to LPV/r which is taken twice daily and has higher pill burden. Furthermore, ATV/r is more affordable than LPV/r ($2 less per patient per month). Therefore, ATV/r is the preferred PI when DTG was used in the first-line regimen.

All PLHIV should receive resistance testing to inform the prescription of 2nd and 3rd-line medicines
* In case of susceptibility to all drugs, use the table to guide the preferred or alternative choices.
* Since all 3rd-line PLHIV will have prior PI Exposure, DRV/r will be taken twice a day.
* For recipients of care on NNRTI-based First Line regimen whose VL is not suppressed, switch without a second VL but conduct IAC to improve adherence to new regimen.
* All PLHIV on raltegravir should be immediately transitioned to DTG if there are no contra indications irrespective of the VL status.

6.16.4 Programmatic Drug Substitution on 2nd Line
Regimens

Adults on ATV/r or LPV/r-based 2nd line regimens who are virally suppressed (basing on VL result within the past 6 months) and who did not receive DTG in their 1st line regimens should have ATV/r or LPV/r substituted with DTG.

<a id='8b64d272-7daf-48b9-a691-0f539387847a'></a>

Pregnant and breastfeeding women on ATV/r or LPV/r-based 2nd line
regimens who are virally suppressed and who did not receive DTG in
their 1stlineregimens should be maintained on the same regimens. At 6-9
months postpartum, if their VL is suppressed (basing on VL result within
past 6 months), ATV/r or LPV/r should be substituted with DTG.

especially in children and adolescents in whom twice-daily dosing may hinder
adherence.

## 6.17 THIRD-LINE ART REGIMENS
### 6.17.1 Eligibility for Third-Line ART

Patients on second-line ART who meet the following criteria are eligible for third line ARVs:
* If they have a detectable viral load test result >1000 copies/ml at the repeat viral load test following intensified adherence counseling.
* The patient should have had three intensified adherence counseling sessions one month apart after the initial detectable viral load.
* The patient has three consecutive scores of adherence >95% as determined by adherence support team. In case the 3 scores are less than 95%, then do DOTs for three months and repeat VL irrespective of adherence scores.

<a id='424b52fb-52bf-4bdc-8031-88c6434f0241'></a>

## 6.17.2 When a patient on second line has suspected resistance to secondline ART

When a patient on second-line ART is suspected to be failing on second-line ART following the first unsuppressed viral load, and the adherence scores are > 95% for three consecutive IAC sessions, the following should be done:

*   Two samples of venous blood should be taken off and sent to CPHL (Central Public Health Laboratories).
*   The samples should be accompanied by the combined viral load and HIV drug resistance form. The first sample will be used by CPHL to conduct the repeat viral load test. Once the result is > 200 or 400 copies/ Ml for plasma and DBS respectively, CPHL will proceed to facilitate the geno typing process either by CPHL, JCRC or UVRI as may be deemed necessary
*   The resistance test results will be dispatched by CPHL to respective regions for action. The regional teams will review the results alongside the patient details and make the decision to switch or not to switch the patient to third-line ART. Please refer to Figure 63 for the third-line ART flow chart.
*   The case discussion and decision reached will always be instituted in the HIV DR data base for monitoring by the National team.

### 6.17.3 Recommended third-line regimens for adults, adolescents and children

The recommended anchor drug for third-line regimens for adults, adolescents and children will be ritonavir-booster Darunavir (DRV/r). DTG will be considered for children <20Kg who utilized DRV/r for their second-line regimen. However, selection of third-line ART regimens will be guided by resistance profiling of the antiretroviral drugs. In the initial phase of implementation of the third-line ART program within the national system, the drugs will be kept at the regional referral hospitals to which the health facilities will make their orders. For details on guidance on how to order for and report on third-line ART, refer to Chapter 13.

with HIV

<a id='095b0614-a481-47f6-b021-1b2582923139'></a>

- Optimization of ART regimens with more efficacious and durable drugs and simplified dosing is recommended for improved long-term viral suppression.
- The preferred first-line ART for all adults, adolescents and children is Dolutegravir-based.
- PLHIV on NNRTI-based first-line regimens should have their viral loads assessed. If virally suppressed, their ART should be transitioned to optimal preferred first-line regimens. If not suppressed, the patients should be switched to second-line ART with IAC.
- PLHIV initiated on DTG should be longitudinally monitored for adverse effects following recommended pharmacovigilance protocols.
- Newly diagnosed pregnant and breastfeeding women shall be initiated on TDF+3TC+DTG or TAF+FTC+DTG.
- Pregnant and breastfeeding women already on TLE should be maintained on this regimen until 6-9 months postpartum when they should be transitioned to TLD if the VL within the past 6 months is suppressed.
- Women becoming pregnant while on DTG-based regimens shall be maintained on the regimen.
- Treatment should be monitored by measuring viral load 6 months after initiation of ART and every 6-12 months or when clinically indicated.
- A repeat viral load of >1000cells/mm3 suggests treatment failure and is indication for HIV DR and appropriate switch after ruling out adherence challenges.
- The preferred second-line ART for adults, adolescents and children are either DTG-based or PI-based, depending on the failing first-line regimens.
- Second and third line regimens shall be guided by genotype (resistance) testing.

# 7 SERVICE DELIVERY APPROACHES

This chapter will discuss differentiated service delivery for PLHIV including children, adolescents and Adults, the comprehensive community service delivery approach and continuous quality improvement in DSD.

<a id='d730a435-80a6-41af-bafb-74dbe9d08ca5'></a>

7.1 DIFFERENTIATED SERVICE DELIVERY (DSD)
Differentiated service delivery refers to various ways of providing HIV prevention, care and treatment services that are tailored to the needs and preferences of PLHIV with the aim of maintaining good clinical outcomes and improving efficiency in service delivery.

<a id='fd478880-9549-4734-9dd8-e234e9dc9d79'></a>

Differentiated service delivery will improve the efficiency of existing approaches. It addresses individuals' needs, informs targeted interventions with better outcomes among clients; improve access, coverage and quality of services and lead to efficient utilization of resources.

<a id='432f09dc-e74d-49a3-aebc-510712f5a355'></a>

This section presents the recommended differentiated service models for HTS, care and treatment for PLHIV and TB for adoption by the facilities and communities managing PHLIV. The details on how the differentiated care models will be implemented in Uganda are described in the Implementation guide for Differentiated Service Delivery Models (DSDM) for HIV and TB services in Uganda (version November 2022).

<a id='238a191b-6ba9-4122-b4d2-c46527376dd6'></a>

### 7.1.1 Core principles of differentiated service delivery
The core principles of differentiated care are client-centered and improved health system efficiency.

<a id='9d125e8f-2c75-427d-8f0a-6619e652fa85'></a>

a) Client-centered care

The core principle for differentiating care is to provide ART delivery in a way that acknowledges specific barriers identified by clients and empowers them to manage their disease with the support of the health system. WHO highlights the need for client-centered care to improve the quality of HIV care services.
